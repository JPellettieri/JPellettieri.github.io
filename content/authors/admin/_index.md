    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I work at the intersection of data analysis and science communication. I am interested in understanding natural patterns through quantitative tools while also finding effective ways to convey that knowledge.

I enjoy transforming data into clear and engaging visualizations, making complex information more accessible. My approach combines analytical rigor with creativity, bringing a fresh perspective to problem-solving and teamwork.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
