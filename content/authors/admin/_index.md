## About Me

I work at the intersection of data analysis and science communication. I am interested in understanding natural patterns through quantitative tools while also finding effective ways to convey that knowledge.

I enjoy transforming data into clear and engaging visualizations, making complex information more accessible. My approach combines analytical rigor with creativity, bringing a fresh perspective to problem-solving and teamwork.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
