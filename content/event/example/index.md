summary: Tree rings capture variations in radioactive carbon-14, formed by cosmic radiation influenced by solar activity.
abstract: Solar activity plays a crucial role in modulating cosmic radiation reaching the Earth. When high-energy cosmic rays interact with atmospheric particles, they generate radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14, which are incorporated into tree rings as trees grow. By studying these isotopic variations in annual growth rings, researchers can reconstruct historical solar activity and its impact on Earth's climate. This presentation examines the correlation between solar cycles, cosmic radiation, and tree-ring records, demonstrating how dendrochronology serves as a powerful tool for understanding past solar behavior and climate dynamics.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Hugo Blox Builder's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes]https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1729lj5d37dhfIF98m5um5VKM4azGXbmm77Z1B0wq1iE/edit?usp=sharing).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
